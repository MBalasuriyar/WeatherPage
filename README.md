# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. Uses `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Working Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN you search for a city
THEN you are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN you view current weather conditions for that city
THEN you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN you view the UV index
THEN you are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city
THEN you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN you click on a city in the search history
THEN you are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
